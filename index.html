<h1>Bachelor's Degrees in Electrical & Systems Science Engineering</h1>

<div class="container">
<div class="row">
<div class="col-xs-6">

<p> The department offers two professional degrees: BS in Electrical Engineering and a BS in Systems Science & Engineering. We also offer two more flexible non-professional degrees: BS in Applied Science (Electrical Engineering) and BS in Applied Science (Systems Science & Engineering).</p>

<h2> BS in Electrical Engineering </h2>
<p>The BS in Electrical Engineering (BSEE) degree program consists of a breadth of knowledge in electrical engineering, a depth of knowledge in a particular area, and preparation for life-long learning. Breadth of knowledge is ensured through basic courses in the conceptual foundations of electrical engineering, fundamental tools of modern practice, advanced laboratories, and a significant design experience. Depth of knowledge is made possible by a wide selection of upper-level electives that allow students to focus in a particular area. Finally, students are prepared for lifelong learning through courses in technical communication, laboratory, and project team activities, courses in the humanities and social sciences, and opportunities to participate in departmental research activities. The B.S. in Electrical Engineering is accredited by the Engineering Accreditation Commission of ABET, http://www.abet.org.</p>

<h2> BSAS in Electrical Engineering </h2>
<p> Students who do not plan to pursue a career in electrical engineering, but seek a strong foundation in the principles of electrical engineering may choose the Bachelor of Science in Applied Science (Electrical Engineering). The program ensures that the student learns the foundations of electrical engineering through breadth requirements. There is flexibility in selecting upper-level courses to meet the students individual objectives. This program may also be attractive for students interested in obtaining multiple degrees, because the requirements are less strict than for the BSEE degree.</p>

<h2> BS in Systems Science & Engineering </h2>
<p>This program educates students in the engineering and science of systems. Graduates are expected to have mathematical competence and knowledge of systems analysis, control, and design methods, numerical methods, differential equations, dynamic systems theory, automatic control theory, system stability, estimation, optimization, modeling, identification, simulation, and basic computer programming. You will have an engineering outlook and engineers competence of your own and be able to interact fully with other engineers. You also will possess sufficient proficiency in computer use to design algorithms for simulation, estimation, control, and optimization.</p>
<p>The engineering departments of high-technology industries are staffed by large numbers of engineers with this type of expertise. However, graduates are by no means restricted to careers in traditional industry or in high-technology industries. Within the outlined framework, a salient feature of the program is its flexibility and interdisciplinary nature. It is possible for you to orient study toward preparation for systems science and engineering work in large complex systems such as transportation or power or communications networks or in societal systems such as the economy, ecology, the cities, or biological systems. You may wish to prepare for work along theoretical or professional lines. There is ample room in the program structure to accommodate all these interests and to make your preparation at the BS level ideally suited for your future plans and interests. The B.S. in Systems Science & Engineering is accredited by the Engineering Accreditation Commission of ABET, http://www.abet.org.</p>

<h2> BSAS in Systems Science & Engineering </h2>
<p>This program provides you with the opportunity to prepare your academic career with maximum flexibility, but with enough organization to assure substantive, consistent training in systems science methodology and outlook. This program is advantageous if you wish to pursue a program that does not follow conventional lines. It is an especially advantageous component for a double major in association with mathematics, physics, economics, or another engineering discipline. The program can be planned to provide a desirable background for graduate work in biological, medical, or management fields. This nonprofessional degree is not accredited by the Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology (ABET).</p>
